# numpy-basics-learning
Aspiring Data Scientist | Python &amp; NumPy Learner  Currently building a strong foundation in data science using Python. This GitHub showcases my learning projects, hands-on practice, and progress with NumPy, data analysis, and related tools.
# NumPy Basics – Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates **fundamental NumPy concepts**.  
It was created as part of my learning journey in **Python for Data Science**.

The goal of this project is to understand how NumPy arrays work and how they are used for numerical computations and matrix operations.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
The script includes examples of:

- Creating **1D and 2D NumPy arrays**
- Exploring array properties:
  - `ndim` – number of dimensions
  - `shape` – rows and columns
  - `size` – total number of elements
- **Indexing and slicing** arrays
- Performing **element-wise operations**:
  - Addition
  - Multiplication
- **Matrix multiplication** using `np.dot`
- Basic **statistical operations**, such as calculating the mean

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed  
2. Install NumPy:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
3. Run the script:
   python numpy_basics.py
